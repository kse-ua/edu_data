The repository is created by the Education in Emergencies Research Office at the Kyiv School Institute within the multi-year Ukraine Resilience Program (MYRP) of the ECW 2024-26 Global Fund. The repository is open for contribution by all organizations of MYRP Consortia  participating in the research or other education activities; some of the data sets will be publicly available. 

**About:**
Since the onset of the full-scale invasion in Ukraine, the role of data in education has become more crucial than ever. Amidst the destruction of infrastructure and displacement, educational institutions have had to adapt rapidly to ensure continuity in learning. Data enables authorities, organizations, and educators to identify gaps in resources, and deliver targeted support to affected regions. 

The idea of Comprehensive Repository of Education Data in Ukraine is to facilitate data exchange between different educational organizations, foster research and informed project and  policy decisions. This repository supports the collection and accessibility of critical data about education in Ukraine for research, project and policy development.
